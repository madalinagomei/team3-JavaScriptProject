Hey there 👋


After completing the JavaScript course, we wanted to reinforce the 📌 knowledge we gained and implement the 📃 final project within two weeks.

🎨 We developed three versions of the “Filmoteka” website: mobile, tablet, and desktop.

🛠️ We were provided with technical specifications describing the functionality of the future site, and we reserved the right to make improvements by adding features like user profiles and a direct “remove” button for films on the film card, without opening a modal.

👨‍🎓 The project involved five people, as follows:

Team Leader and Developer: Madalina Gomei
Scrum Master and Developer: Cezara-Alexandra Firu
Developer: Richard-Iulian Prudel
Developer: Sara Angelica Smarandoiu
Developer: Stefan Foca

Clicking on the “Team 3” text in the footer reveals a modal with information about team members and details about their contributions to the project.

💻 Our goal was to create a website that matches the desired appearance and fulfills all assigned tasks from the technical specifications. The main purpose of the site is to display movies and view their IMDb ratings and info, search for specific films, and organize the user’s library for managing favorite and queue lists, as well as providing login functionality.

✅ Throughout the project:

- We practiced teamwork skills using Git.
- We followed the Scrum methodology.
- We consolidated our knowledge of HTML and CSS.
- We reinforced the JavaScript knowledge gained during the course.


As a result of well-coordinated teamwork 🤝, our project turned out as follows: ⬇
